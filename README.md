Copying A File


	This program is desined to copy a txt file, from a user specified path (example: "C:\\Users\\Reaper\\Desktop\\a\\file.txt") to a destination given the path the user enters (example: "C:\\Users\\Reaper\\Desktop\\b\\this.txt"). The try/catch block encircling the entire method is a formality as all errors possible should be handeled by their corisponding if statements (exculding permissions error and not enough free space error; which I couldn't get to work properlly, although both errors will still be caught by the try/catch block without a problem).
